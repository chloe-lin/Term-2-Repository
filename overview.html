			<p>The viola is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound. Since the 18th century, it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below). 
			The word viola originates from the Italian language. The Italians often used the term: viola da braccio meaning literally: 'of the arm'. "Brazzo" was another Italian word for the viola, which the Germans adopted as Bratsche.
			The viola often plays the "inner voices" in string quartets and symphonic writing. Music that is written for the viola differs from that of most other instruments, in that it primarily uses the alto clef, which is otherwise rarely used.
