			<p>I started viola last September. My strings teacher at school had asked who would volunteer to play viola and I raised my hand. She chose two others, one whose sister had played viola and another who used to play viola, to join me. To this day, we’re all really close and I’m glad that my teacher had me play viola.
			
			Because I had roughly six years of violin experience, it wasn’t too hard to switch. There was the problem of a new clef to read but I figured out a way to read it quite quickly.
			
			I personally like playing the viola more than the violin. I like the nice, warm sound the viola produces, and soon found that the violin was too high-pitched for me. The competition between violins is also insane. You have to play at a very high level to get into orchestras and many of the violinists I know are significantly better at playing violin than I am, and are at a much higher level.
			
			The music that violas get in orchestras tends to be easy, which I enjoyed. I didn’t have to worry about shifting or too many double stops so I could focus on just making my notes sound nice. 
			I’ve met some of my best friends through playing viola so I’m thankful that I switched at the beginning of grade 8.
